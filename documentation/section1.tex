\section{Introduction}
This format is to be used for submissions that are published in the
conference publications. We wish to give this volume a consistent,
high-quality appearance. We therefore ask that authors follow some
simple guidelines. In essence, you should format your paper exactly
like this document. The easiest way to do this is to replace the
content with your own material.
